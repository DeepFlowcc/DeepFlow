Overview
DeepFlow is a pioneering platform that redefines AI-driven code generation for Web3 applications. Seamlessly connect your Web3 wallet to a browser-based Web Container and build, debug, and deploy Web3 apps in an intuitive WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) environment. With DeepFlow, unleash your creativity, accelerate development, and lead the blockchain revolution.
Key Features
Multi-Modal Creation: Generate code from hand-drawn sketches, screenshots, or natural language.

Zero-Coding Simplicity: No programming expertise required—just one click to build apps.

Multi-Agent Engine: Intelligent agents streamline front-end and back-end development.

Web3 Ready: Supports wallet integration, crypto transactions, and blockchain data queries.

Continuous Refinement: Optimize code effortlessly through natural language interactions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js 16+ (for Web Container)

A modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)

A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet)

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/username/deepflow.git
cd deepflow

Install dependencies:
bash

npm install

Launch the platform:
bash

npm run start

Usage
Quick Example: Build a Web3 App
Open DeepFlow in your browser.

Link your Web3 wallet.

Upload a sketch or screenshot of your desired interface.

Describe your app in natural language, e.g., "Create a BSC wallet connector."

Get the generated code and test it live in the Web Container.

Sample Output
javascript

const connectBSCWallet = async () => {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
  await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);
  return provider.getSigner();
};
